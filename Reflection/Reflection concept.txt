Reflection is the process of describing the metadata of types, methods and fields in a code.
It is a feature using which we can reflect on an assembly, to get the types and other information. We can take the assembly and from that assembly we can figure out what are the different types defined in the assembly, and inside of each type, what are the different methods, properties and fields, and then we can also invoke those properties and fields, creating an object, we can do all of these using reflection and not essentially doing a new on that type. In other words, we can use reflection to dynamically create an instance of a type, bind the type to an existing object, or get the type from an existing object. We can then invoke the type's methods or access its fields and properties.
